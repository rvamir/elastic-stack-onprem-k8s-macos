# Elastic Stack on-prem with Helm on macOS

# Setting up the Elastic Stack on macOS using Docker Compose

This guide covers deploying Elasticsearch and Kibana locally on macOS using Docker Compose for a persistent and easy-to-manage Elastic Stack setup.

## Overview

- Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana directly using Docker containers.
- Use Docker Compose to simplify startup, shutdown, and persistent data handling.
- Enables quick redeployment without losing data.
- Optionally, if local setup is difficult, you can use the [Elastic Cloud free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co).

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running on macOS
- Basic Docker and command-line knowledge
- `curl` or similar HTTP client for API testing

## Steps to Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**

2. **Start the stack:**

docker-compose up -d
Verify Elasticsearch is running by sending an API request:

curl http://localhost:9200
You should receive a JSON response with cluster info.

Access Kibana UI:

Open http://localhost:5601 in your web browser.

Persistence
Docker volumes are configured in docker-compose.yml to ensure Elasticsearch and Kibana data persist across restarts.
volume elastic-stack-onprem-k8s-macos_es_data is a Docker-managed persistent volume.
Data inside /usr/share/elasticsearch/data within the container is stored persistently in the named Docker volume.
The volume physically lives inside Docker Desktopâ€™s VM, but it keeps your data safe across container restarts.

Monitoring Resource Usage
To determine the CPU and memory consumption of the Elastic applications, use the following command:


docker stats

Example output:
CONTAINER ID   NAME          CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O           BLOCK I/O        PIDS
25d573f9bfca   kibana        2.34%     619.1MiB / 7.654GiB   7.90%     5.43MB / 30.9MB   288MB / 4.1kB    12
976ddaec5833   elasticsearch 3.18%     4.428GiB / 7.654GiB   57.86%    25.9MB / 4.94MB  
 
Alternatively, system tools like:
macOS Activity Monitor top in Terminal


Troubleshooting & Notes
The version attribute in docker-compose.yml is deprecated and has been removed to avoid warnings.

Ensure Docker Desktop has sufficient RAM allocated (recommend at least 8GB) for Elasticsearch to run smoothly.

Elasticsearch requires enough memory; otherwise, it may fail to start or perform poorly.
